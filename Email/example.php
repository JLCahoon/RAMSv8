/*****************************************************************
  Problems Sending The Email?
  
  If you receive this message "ERROR: The Email could not be sent." 
  
  Then you probably just need to configure your mail server. The 
  situation where I see this the most is with people running WAMP 
  as a local development server. Check with your web host to find 
  out your mail server settings. You will need to know:
    * the address of the mail server
    * the port to use on the mail server
    * the address to use that you will send mail from
  Then lookup the PHP function ini_set()
    http://php.net/manual/en/function.ini-set.php
  Finally add to the top of this file code like this...
    ini_set("SMTP","mail.domain.com");
    ini_set("SMTP_PORT", 25);
    ini_set("sendmail_from","yourname@domain.com");
